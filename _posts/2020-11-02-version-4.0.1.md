[Version 4.0.1](https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell/releases/tag/v4.0.1) of Nuspell is out. Now it can handle .dic files with CRLF line endings. CMake scripts now support unusual install prefixes. Loading times have been improved by avoiding temporaries in hash-table insertions. Finally the man-page generations has been migrated from Ronn to Pandoc. See the changelog for further details.
