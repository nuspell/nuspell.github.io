Nuspell has been released. New API for finding dictionaries on the filesystem
that uses facilities from C++17 `std::filesystem` has been added. CLI tool has
been simplified and some unused features have been removed. The old API for
finding dictionaries on the filesystem that used strings for paths has been
deprecated. The man-page for CLI tool and dependency on pandoc have been
