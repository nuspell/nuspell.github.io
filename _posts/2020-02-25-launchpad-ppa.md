Nuspell has now a [Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~nuspell/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+packages). This offers binary packages for all architectures of supported Ubuntu releases. That is currently amd64, arm64, armhf and i386 for Bionic, Disco, Eoan and Focal. Note that the latter is not building for i386 anymore.
