[Version 5.0.1](https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell/releases/tag/v5.0.1) of
Nuspell has been released. Parsing of `.dic` files for some problematic
dictionaries has been fixed. Internal calls to `icu::UnicodeString::toTitle()`
have been simplified, which results with a minor speedup. This enables Nuspell
to be linked to unconventional ICU builds without break iterator, like the one
in Firefox. This version requires GCC 8 as minimal version of GCC because
internally `std::from_chars()` is used now.
