[Enchant](https://abiword.github.io/enchant/) offers access to providers of
several spelling checkers to dozens of software packages. We have integrated
support for Nuspell which has been included in Enchant's
[version 2.2.8](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant/blob/master/NEWS). This is
one of many steps to bring Nuspell closer to its end users.
