Nuspell will have an [information stand](https://fosdem.org/2020/stands/) at both days of FOSDEM 2020 on the first floor of building K. Drop by if you would like to know more about our spell checker and meet some of the people behind it. We also give a talk in the Coding for Language Communities devroom and we have free hexagon stickers!
