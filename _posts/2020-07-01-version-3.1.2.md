We have released [version 3.1.2](https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell/releases/tag/v3.1.2) of Nuspell. Here, internal refactorings that reduce function templates in utils and finder. The file utils.hxx is not installed any more. It is now a private header. Some functions for searching dictionaries in class Finder are deprecated as they were searching in directories that no longer contain dictionaries.
