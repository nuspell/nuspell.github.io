Nuspell [version 4.0](https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell/releases/tag/v4.0.0) is out. The library no longer depends on Boost anymore, only the CLI does. The CLI now uses Unicode segmentation by default, while white-space segmentation remains available. Furthermore, there are some library and API improvements, bug fixes and deprecated code has been removed. See the changelog for further details.
