[Version 5.0.0](https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell/releases/tag/v5.0.0) of
Nuspell has been released. Memory usage has been reduced greatly and speed
of spellchecking has been improved. Long lagging suggestions in edge cases
has been fixed, as is building on OS Haiku. Source and header files for
the dictionary are split into multiple files resulting in a header file with
no more private details. Functions and classes that have been deprecated in
version 4 have been removed.
