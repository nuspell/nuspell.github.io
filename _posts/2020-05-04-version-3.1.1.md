[Version 3.1.1](https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell/releases/tag/v3.1.1) of Nuspell has been released. The README has been updated, mainly to help packaging efforts. Third-party software, which is only used for testing purposes, is now stored seperately. Additionally, bugs related to FreeBSD and NetBSD have been fixed in order to distribute Nuspell on these operating systems too.
