We will again give a talk at FOSDEM in Brussels. Join us on Saturday February 1, 2020, from 16:30 until 17:00 in room AW1.120. This is the Coding for Language Communities devroom where we will [discuss Nuspell version 3](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/clc_nuspell_version_3_of_the_new_spell_checker/). Additionally, we also have an information stand at FOSDEM in building K.
