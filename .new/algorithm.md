# UML activity diagrams

The algorithms used in the implementation are illustrated here with [UML activity diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram). Each major method is described in a minimal way. Additionally, the diagrams illustrate actual paths of activity, whereas the API documentation describes in a more technical way more the possibilities that the implementation provides.

 The UML doesn't require the reader to understand C++ code. However, all method names are maintained so that looking up the C++ is possible. The color blue indicates where another method is being called. The color red indicates termination of the application.
